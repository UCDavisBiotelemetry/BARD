# BARD
This is a feedback-only "repository" for the Biotelemetry Autonomous and Real-time Database.

BARD can be found at http://cftc.metro.ucdavis.edu/biotelemetry-autonomous-real-time-database/

Please use the "issues" tab to give feedback and suggestions for BARD or related telemetry websites.

What features would you like to see added? Do you like something some other telemetry site has that we don't? Did you encounter any bugs?
