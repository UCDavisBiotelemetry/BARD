# BARD
This is a feedback-only "repository" for the Biotelemetry Autonomous and Real-time Database website.

BARD can be found at http://cftc.metro.ucdavis.edu/biotelemetry-autonomous-real-time-database/

Please use the "issues" tab to give feedback and suggestions for BARD or related telemetry websites.

What features would you like to see added? Do you like something some other telemetry site has that we don't? Do you know of any other regional groups that tag fish or put out receivers that we should be in contact with? Did you encounter any bugs?

If you are interested in adding data to BARD, please see https://github.com/UCDavisBiotelemetry/vue-to-cftc
